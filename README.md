# Recast.AI starter kit PHP

A starter kit for developing bots on the [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai) platform.

> **Note:** This project is currently in beta version and can be modified at any time.

## Requirements

#### PHP

We recommend to use at least `PHP v7.0`


#### Recast.AI account

Create an account on the [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai) platform and follow this [quick tutorial](https://recast.ai/gettingstarted) to create your first bot on the interface.

## Usage


#### Installation

`git clone git@github.com:RecastAI/starter-PHP.git my-bot && cd my-bot`

Using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/):
`composer install`

#### Create the config file

 Create a `config.php` file in the `src` directory of your project, copy/paste these lines:

```php
<?php

$_ENV["REQUEST_TOKEN"] = "";
$_ENV["LANGUAGE"] = "";

// Write your own configuration here:
// ...
```

Complete the Recast.AI `$_ENV["REQUEST_TOKEN"]` and `$_ENV["LANGUAGE"]`: go to your bot page, click on the settings icon (on the right side of your screen), and copy the `request_token`.
Then, set the default language of your bot: `'en'`, `'fr'`... or leave this field empty for auto-detection language

Tips: This config. file will never be pushed onto your repository.


#### Run locally

Run the following command: `php -S localhost:5000`

> **Note:** Next steps, only if you have connected your bot to channels, using the Bot Connector tool

- download [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
- launch it: `./ngrok http 5000`
- copy the url ngrok gave and paste it in the [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai) interface: Go to your bot page, click on the **RUN** tab and edit your `current bot webhook`
- Chat with your bot on the channels you've configured ;)

#### Alternative, if you are not using **Bot Connector**

If you're not using the Bot Connector to connect your bot to the channels, you will only need to change the `bot.php` file and the `message.php` file and make changes depending on the way you want to receive the message.
